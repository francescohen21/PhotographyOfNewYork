    <h2> What is the photography of New York? </h2>
    <p> It's any photography taken of or in the city! That includes photos of buildings, parks, people, major events in New York, or any other scene.</p>
    <h2> Why am I interested in it? </h2>
    <p> I've been taking photography at school for several years now, and I really love it.
      I've also lived in New York for my entire life, so I wanted to explore the intersection
      between the two! </p>
