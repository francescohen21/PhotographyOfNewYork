    "text": "Joel Sternfeld's 'Walking the High Line' shows the High Line looking very different than it does now. After it 's time as a railway carrying freight across the city, it was almost demolished.However, due in part to Sternfeld 's photo and the rest of his photo series, the public, and more importantly the major, were everntually convinced that the High Line was worth saving.Proceeds from his book then went on the turning the once abandoned railway into the thriving park that we know it as today."

    "text": "While not born in New York, Berenice Abbott lived in the city for many years. After returning back to the New York before the Great Depression, she was supprised by how the landscape had changed. So with the funding from the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project, she documented the transformation of the city in a series of breathtaking photos where the people are not the subjects, but the buildings. \n These photos held a lot of significance to the city as it was then, and even now. They showed people how their inidvidual and collective actions had an effect on the very city surrounding them. Abbott demonstrated to her audience the ways in which those actions helped but also harmed, converying her feelings towards the old and the new through images that resonate even after its subject is long gone."
