      Joel Sternfeld&#39;s &#39;Walking the High Line&#39; shows the High Line looking very different than it does now. After its time as a railway carrying freight across the city, it was almost demolished. However, due in part to Sternfeld &#39;s &#39;Walking the High Line&#39; and the rest of his photo series, the public, and more importantly the major, were everntually convinced that the High Line was worth saving. Proceeds from his book then went on to turning the once abandoned railway into the thriving park that we know it as today. <!-- para 1 -->

      If you&#39;re interested, make sure to check out some of his other work. His &#39;When It Changed&#39; contains shots of delegates at the 2005 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Montreal, and his &#39;On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam&#39; speaks to violence in America. While not photos of New York, if you&#39;re curious I&#39;d suggest taking a look! <!-- para 2 -->
